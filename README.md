# Ansible Caesar Cipher
When you run `caesar-encode.yml` as a playbook with Ansible, it encrypts all of the files in your current directory. It does so using Caesar cipher, shifting all the letters in each file by one. A becomes B, B becomes C, and so on.

`caesar-decode.yml` decrypts your files, shifting each letter the other way.
